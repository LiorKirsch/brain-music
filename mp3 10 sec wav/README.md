BRAIN MUSIC
===========

This folder contains the 10 sec wav files.
It also contains a fixSoundFile script which coverts the mono wav song 
into a stereo wav song.  In the second setreo channel you will find 
a square wave function which marks the begining of the song.

To generate the "fixed" sound files run main_fix_sound.m
